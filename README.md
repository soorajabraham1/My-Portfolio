# [Project 1: DC-GAN](https://github.com/soorajabraham1/Computer-Vision--DCGAN) 
* Trained a powerful generative model using TensorFlow. 
* Generated MNIST Digits after training the Generator and discriminator. 
* Wrote a blog on medium by explaining each steps for implementation. link:(https://github.com/soorajabraham1/Computer-Vision--DCGAN)

# [Project 2: Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penality](https://github.com/soorajabraham1/Computer-Vision--DCGAN) 
* GANs are powerful generative models but suffer from training instability.
* WGAN makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only low-quality samples or fail to converge.
* These problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic.
* to solve this, the norm of gradient of the critic is penalized with respect to its input.

# [Project 2: Conditional GAN](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
* This GAN can generate MNIST digits conditioned on class labels
* Inputs a class vector along with the noise to generate specific class. 
* The input is a concatenated vector of noise and class. 
* The noise vector is one-hot encoded.

# [Project 3: Controllable GAN](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
* Trained on the celebrity dataset to generate new faces of people. 
* Obtained controlled generation of faces such as smiling, beard, blad head.

# [Project 3: Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
* This is one of my kaggle projects. 
* Trained on MNIST dataset. Identifies the hand written digits. 
* Further developed a web based digit recognition page that predicts the digit drawn by mouse.
