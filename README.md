# [Project 1: DC-GAN](https://github.com/soorajabraham1/Computer-Vision--DCGAN) 
* Trained a powerful generative model using TensorFlow. 
* Generated MNIST Digits after training the Generator and discriminator. 
* Wrote a blog on medium by explaining each steps for implementation. link:(https://github.com/soorajabraham1/Computer-Vision--DCGAN)

# [Project 2: Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penality](https://github.com/soorajabraham1/Computer-Vision--DCGAN) 
* GANs are powerful generative models but suffer from training instability.
* WGAN makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only low-quality samples or fail to converge.
* These problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic.
* to solve this, the norm of gradient of the critic is penalized with respect to its input.

# [Project 2: Conditional GAN](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
* This GAN can generate MNIST digits conditioned on class labels
* Inputs a class vector along with the noise to generate specific class. 
* The input is a concatenated vector of noise and class. 
* The noise vector is one-hot encoded.

# [Project 3: Controllable GAN](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
* Trained on the celebrity dataset to generate new faces of people. 
* Obtained controlled generation of faces such as smiling, beard, blad head.

# [Project 3: Sentiment_Analysis_NLP](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
* Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral
* scrapped data from social media website-Twitter.
* Cleaned the textual data.
* Lemmatization was done - process of converting a word to its base form. for example the word better is converted to good which is its base form.
* Removed stop words.

# [Project 4: Tiny_Nerf-3D-Reconstruction](https://github.com/soorajabraham1/Tiny_Nerf-3D-Reconstruction) 
* Reconstructed a scene of a JBL speaker.
* It wasnt clearly reconstructed as the image was captured using hand held smartphone.

# [Project 4: Optical-Character-Recognition](https://github.com/soorajabraham1/Optical-Character-Recognition-with-EasyOCR-PyTorch) 
* EasyOCR is a Python-based library for using a ready-to-use OCR model.
* Extracted the words from the images.
* Displayed the extracted sentences on the image itself.
