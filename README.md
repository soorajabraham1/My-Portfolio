Hi There


I am sooraj Abraham , a computer vision engineer and a deep learning related blogger on medium. I am also Pursuing my masters in Scientific Instrumentation. I am more intrested into Generative Adversarial Networks and currently doing projects in it.

I am really enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge in AI. In 2022, I started sharing my learnings to to the world by blogging in medium and sharing the code in github and made a name for myself.

Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from football, swimming and traveling with friends.

books I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. My favorite ones are The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho in the genre of Adventure and Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki in the genre of financial literacy.

# Projects


# [Project 1: DC-GAN](https://github.com/soorajabraham1/Computer-Vision--DCGAN) 
* Train a powerful generative model.
* Generated MNIST Digits datas after training the Generator and discriminator.
* Generated fake images of people from the celebrity dataset.

# [Project 2: Contrallable GAN](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
