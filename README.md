Hi There


I am sooraj Abraham , a computer vision engineer and a deep learning related blogger on medium. I am also Pursuing my masters in Scientific Instrumentation. I am more intrested into Generative Adversarial Networks and currently doing projects in it.

I am really enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge in AI. In 2022, I started sharing my learnings to to the world by blogging in medium and sharing the code in github and made a name for myself.

Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from football, swimming and traveling with friends.

books I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. My favorite ones are The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho in the genre of Adventure and Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki in the genre of financial literacy.

# Projects


# [Project 1: DC-GAN](https://github.com/soorajabraham1/Computer-Vision--DCGAN) 
* Train a powerful generative model.
* Generated MNIST Digits datas after training the Generator and discriminator.
* Generated fake Handwritten MNIST datas.

# [Project 2: Conditional GAN](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
* Inputs a class vector along with the noise to generate specific class. The input is a concatenated vector of noise and class.
* The noise vector is one-hot encoded.
* 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.

# [Project 3: Controllable GAN](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
* Trained on the celebrity dataset to generate new faces of people.
* obtained controlled generation of faces such as smiling, beard, blad head.
