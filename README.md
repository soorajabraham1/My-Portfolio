# [Project 1: DC-GAN](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
* Train a powerful generative model. 
* Generated MNIST Digits datas after training the Generator and discriminator. 
* Generated fake Handwritten MNIST datas.

# [Project 2: Conditional GAN](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
* Inputs a class vector along with the noise to generate specific class. 
* The input is a concatenated vector of noise and class. 
* The noise vector is one-hot encoded.

# [Project 3: Controllable GAN](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
* Trained on the celebrity dataset to generate new faces of people. 
* Obtained controlled generation of faces such as smiling, beard, blad head.

# [Project 3: Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
* This is one of my kaggle projects. 
* Trained on MNIST dataset. Identifies the hand written digits. 
* Further developed a web based digit recognition page that predicts the digit drawn by mouse.
