Hi There

I am sooraj Abraham , a computer vision engineer and a deep learning related blogger on medium. I am also Pursuing my masters in Scientific Instrumentation. I am more intrested into Generative Adversarial Networks and currently doing projects in it.

I am really enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge in AI. In 2022, I started sharing my learnings to to the world by blogging in medium and sharing the code in github and made a name for myself.

Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from football, swimming and traveling with friends.

books I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. My favorite ones are The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho in the genre of Adventure and Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki in the genre of financial literacy.

Projects
Project 1: DC-GAN
Train a powerful generative model.
Generated MNIST Digits datas after training the Generator and discriminator.
Generated fake Handwritten MNIST datas.


Project 2: Conditional GAN
Inputs a class vector along with the noise to generate specific class. The input is a concatenated vector of noise and class.
The noise vector is one-hot encoded.


Project 3: Controllable GAN
Trained on the celebrity dataset to generate new faces of people.
obtained controlled generation of faces such as smiling, beard, blad head.
Project 3: Optical-Character-Recognition-with-EasyOCR-PyTorch
Extracted text from images using EasyOCR.
Displayed results using OpenCV.


Project 4: Digit Recognizer
This is one of my kaggle projects.
trained on MNIST dataset.
Identifies the hand written digits.
Further developed a web based digit recognition page that predicts the digit drawn by mouse.
